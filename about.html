			<h2>ME</h2>
			<p>Yes, that's me: Kalene! I'm a 23-year-old busy bee trying to survive my early 20s and a career change. I graduated from Carlow University in 2015 and decided in December of that year I wanted to take up web development. I'm taking risks, learning new things everyday, and work really really hard. I'm having lots of fun in the process!</p>

			<h2>MY CITY...</h2>
			<p>I hail from the city of Pittsburgh where I've had many fond memories and have met some amazing people who've helped me grow and improve my web development skills. I am an Organizer at Girl Develop It! Pittsburgh where I organize events and help teach classes, bringing together women to help support each other code. I am currently attending Academy Pittsburgh where I am working on improving my web development skills.</p>

			<h2>NERD</h2>
			<p>When I'm not coding, I like to take photos of my food and things I find pretty. Here is a flower I really liked at a greenhouse by my house. I also waste a shameful amount of time giggling at memes.</p>
